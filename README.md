# Vaani-Research-Labs
# Machine Learning & Medical Projects 📊🧠💻

This repository contains three Jupyter Notebook projects that apply **machine learning techniques** to real-world problems in healthcare and research.  

## 📂 Projects Included  

1. **🧪 Classifiers ML** (`classifiers_ml.ipynb`)  
   - Focuses on implementing and comparing different **machine learning classifiers**.  
   - Demonstrates preprocessing, training, testing, and evaluation of multiple algorithms.  
   - Great for understanding the trade-offs between models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc.  

2. **🧠 Alzheimer’s Disease Prediction** (`Alzheimer's_Final_Project.ipynb`)  
   - Uses patient data and machine learning to classify the likelihood of **Alzheimer’s disease**.  
   - Explores data cleaning, feature selection, and predictive modeling.  
   - Includes evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) to validate results.  

3. **💥 Trigeminal Neuralgia Project** (`Trigeminal_neuralgia_final_year_project.ipynb`)  
   - A deep-dive into **Trigeminal Neuralgia**, a rare chronic pain condition.  
   - Applies machine learning for early detection/diagnosis using structured data.  
   - Emphasizes data preprocessing, visualization, and classification performance.
